This project presents a dynamic sales dashboard built using **Power BI**, designed to analyze sales, profit, discount, and quantity across various dimensions like category, segment, and region. It also integrates a **30-day sales forecast** using **Facebook Prophet**, developed in **Visual Studio** with Python, allowing for a comparative view alongside Power BI's built-in forecasting tool.
