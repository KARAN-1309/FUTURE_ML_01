🚀 AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard
📊 Machine Learning Task 1 – Future Interns
👨‍💻 By: Karan Jogi

I'm thrilled to share my latest project completed as part of the Data Science & Analytics Internship at Future Interns — an interactive, AI-driven sales forecasting dashboard designed to empower retail decision-making with predictive insights.

🔍 Project Overview:
Using historical Superstore sales data, I built a dynamic sales analytics dashboard in Power BI integrated with Python-based forecasting models (Prophet & Power BI's built-in) to predict sales trends for the next 30 days.

📌 What I Built:

Cleaned and transformed sales data for accuracy and usability

Engineered features like seasonal spikes & category-wise filters

Trained forecasting models using Facebook Prophet and Power BI’s native AI tools

Created an interactive dashboard that allows business users to:
✅ Compare historical vs. forecasted sales
✅ Filter by region, category, segment, or state
✅ Track top-selling items and low-performing periods
✅ View real-time KPIs including sales, profit, discount, and quantity

📈 Key Insights Delivered:

📌 California led in sales volume, while Standard Class dominated shipping preference

💡 Phones & Chairs were top sub-categories in revenue

📉 Sales dip predicted in early January with gradual recovery by month-end

🔍 Dual forecasting models (Prophet & Power BI) helped validate trend consistency

🛠️ Tools Used:

Power BI (for visualization & forecasting)

Python (Facebook Prophet for ML forecasting)

Excel & Jupyter Notebook (for EDA & preprocessing)

👨‍💼 This project honed my skills in data storytelling, business intelligence, forecasting, and sales analytics — aligning directly with real-world needs in retail consulting, SaaS, and data-driven decision-making.
